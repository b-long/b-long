### Hi there, I'm b-long 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently building User Interfaces,
    Web Services (Django and FastAPI), and ETL pipelines
    using Python 🐍
- 🌱 I’m a lifelong learner. I have been learning 
    programming for about 20 years.  I hope to be
    learning programming for the rest of my life. 👴
- 📚 I’m looking for help with C and C++
- 💬 Ask me about Ansible and Raspberry Pi.  
- ⚡ Fun facts inside git: I scored an [Arctic Code Vault] badge!
- ❄️ Fun facts outside of git: I enjoy skiing ⛷ and 
    playing ice hockey 🏒
- 🎇 Most of my collaboration is in private
    git repositories.  So, while my Github contributions may
    not show it, graphing my use of Git looks more like this:
